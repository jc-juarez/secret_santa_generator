# Secret Santa Generator 🎅🎁

A service that powers my family’s Secret Santa ("El intercambio de Navidad", in Spanish) every year for 15+ people. It reads a list of people, shuffles them into a coordinated assignment ring, and sends out the results over WhatsApp (plus an optional backup email just in case; it's our disaster-recovery mechanism).

It’s been used in production twice already and by that I mean it has survived two of my family's Christmases, which definitely counts 😉.
